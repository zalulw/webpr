The database file `database.sqlite` is a binary file created by SQLite and does not contain any human-readable content. Therefore, it cannot be generated as a text file. Instead, the SQLite database file will be created and managed by the application when it runs and executes the necessary SQL commands to create tables and insert data.

To set up the database, you should ensure that the `util/database.js` file contains the necessary code to create the database and its tables when the application starts. The actual `database.sqlite` file will be created automatically by SQLite when the application is executed.

If you need to initialize the database with some sample data, you can do that in your application logic after the database is created.
